To whom it may concern,
This pull request has a several files that need review. In order to achieve functionality you will need to run `npm install` in the root directory as well as edit some environmental variables in server/db to match your local password, host and user names. These will likely be 5432, 'postgres' and the password you have set for postgres. 
You will unless created previously the command

 `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS reviews;`

will need to be run.

### createReview.js in /server/utils

This file is intended to create a single fake user object that will match the columns of my reviews table:

`CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS reviews;`

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS review(
review_id serial primary key,
product_id integer,
rating integer,
recommend integer,
helpfulness integer,
summary varchar(150),
body varchar(2000),
response varchar(2000),
reviewer_name varchar(100),
email varchar(100),
reported boolean,
photos text[5]
);
```

Tests are included with this and do not require setting up the server. Note that when running `npm test` you will have one test suite created on the FE that will fail.

Thank you,
Tim
